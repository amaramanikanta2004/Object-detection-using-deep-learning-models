Object detection using deep learning identifies objects in images by classifying them and drawing bounding boxes around their locations. Popular models include YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), and Faster R-CNN. These models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects in real-time or static images by predicting class labels and box coordinates.
